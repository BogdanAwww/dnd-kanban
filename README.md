# Kanban Board - React TypeScript Project

A modern, feature-rich Kanban board application built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, following a simplified Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) architecture.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **React 18** - Modern React with hooks and functional components
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe development with strict typing
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **Zustand** - Lightweight state management with persistence
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and development server
- **Lucide React** - Beautiful, customizable icons

## 🏗️ Architecture

This project follows a **simplified Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)** structure, adapted for frontend-heavy business logic:

## 📁 Project Structure Details

### Entities Layer
Contains core business entities with their data models and state management:

- **Board** - Board management with Zustand store
- **Card** - Card entity with CRUD operations and persistence
- **Column** - Column management with drag & drop support

### Features Layer
Business features organized by functionality:

- **add-card** - Card creation with inline forms
- **add-column** - Column creation with status selection
- **bulk-operations** - Multi-select and bulk actions
- **card-detail** - Detailed card view sidebar
- **card-search** - Real-time search with highlighting
- **change-priority** - Priority management dropdown
- **column-filter** - Column visibility controls
- **delete-card** - Card deletion with confirmation
- **edit-card** - Inline card editing
- **move-card** - Cross-column card movement
- **view-board** - Main board view with all features

### Shared Layer
Reusable utilities and components:

- **config** - Application configuration
- **lib** - Shared libraries (DnD, selection management)
- **types** - Common TypeScript interfaces
- **ui** - Reusable UI components (Button, Input, etc.)

## 🎯 Key Design Decisions

### Simplified FSD
- **Frontend-heavy logic** - Adapted FSD for complex UI interactions
- **Feature-based organization** - Each feature is self-contained
- **Shared utilities** - Common functionality in shared layer
- **Entity separation** - Clear separation of data and business logic

### State Management
- **Zustand** - Lightweight alternative to Redux
- **Persistence** - Automatic state persistence to localStorage
- **Reactive updates** - Components automatically re-render on state changes
- **Type safety** - Full TypeScript support for state

### UI/UX Design
- **Tailwind CSS** - Rapid development with utility classes
- **Responsive design** - Mobile-first approach
- **Accessibility** - Keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- **Modern interactions** - Drag & drop, multi-select, real-time search

## 🔄 Development Workflow

1. **Feature Development** - Add new features in the `features/` directory
2. **Entity Updates** - Modify entities in the `entities/` directory
3. **Shared Components** - Create reusable components in `shared/ui/`
4. **Type Safety** - Define types in `shared/types/` or entity-specific type files

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
